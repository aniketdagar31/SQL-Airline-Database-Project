SQL Project - Airline Database

This dataset contained an airline company data, with tables for flights, bookings, seats, tickets, airports, boarding passes, and airports.
Conducted indepth analysis of the dataset writing SQL queries to gather key insights on the data.

In this repository, I have created a file with all the SQL queries I used to gather insights on the airline database.
